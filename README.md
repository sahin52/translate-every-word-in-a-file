# Translate Every Word Electron App
This application gets a file with subtitles in it (first release only covers russian), translates every word in it and saves as a csv file.

By this app, you can get every word's translation in a file, study to memorize them and you can better understand the movie.

Helps you learn language faster, saves you a lot of time.

Special thanks to free translation api, libre translate https://translate.astian.org/ , contribute to them: https://github.com/LibreTranslate/LibreTranslate  

Don't ask why this is written with Electron js, I just wanted to learn electron js desktop app development.
